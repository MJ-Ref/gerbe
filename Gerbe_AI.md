# 🌾 Gerbe AI — Weaving Local Insights into Global Intelligence
*A deep‑tech startup grounded in higher‑category theory*

---

## 1 The Problem  
Modern AI stacks work **locally**:

* One LLM per prompt  
* One embedding per silo  
* One rule‑engine per policy

But the *real* world is **global** and **interconnected**.  
‣ Edge devices drift out of sync.  
‣ Micro‑agents contradict each other.  
‣ Regulatory constraints collide in multi‑jurisdiction deployments.

Today’s tooling detects these issues **after** they ship—if at all.

---

## 2 Our Insight  
Mathematics already has machinery for *local‑to‑global* reconciliation:

| Classical object | What it captures | Our analogue |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Bundle** | 1‑st‑order twists (H¹) | Model → adapter |
| **Gerbe** | 2‑nd‑order twists (H²) | *Model⁽¹⁾ ⤳ Model⁽²⁾* conflicts |
| **Stack of groupoids** | Category at every point | Network of reversible transforms |

A **gerbe** glues together many local structures *only if* their higher‑order interactions are consistent.  
That is exactly the guarantee missing from ML pipelines.

## 3 The Product Suite

| Layer | What it is | Customer win |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Gerbe Core** | Open‑source Python library implementing k‑simplex obstruction detection & inverse checks. | Drop‑in CI gate catches contradictions before merge. |
| **Gerbe Cloud** | SaaS dashboard + API that runs Core at scale, stores provenance, emits audit PDFs. | SOC 2 / GDPR compliance & one‑click rollout across teams. |
| **Gerbe Edge** (under active R&D) | SDK for on‑device validation; only overlap‑maps sync to cloud. | Privacy‑preserving federated learning with math‑level guarantees. |

---

## 4 Why We Win  

| Moat | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Mathematical rigor** | Built on degree‑2 cohomology—competitors would need years of PhD talent to replicate. |
| **Domain‑agnostic** | Works for embeddings, JSON policies, model adapters, code‑gen agents—anything with reversible transforms. |
| **Explainable safety** | Outputs human‑readable proofs (graphs + diffs) that auditors and engineers both understand. |
| **Incremental adoption** | Starts as a CI plug‑in; grows to runtime guardrails and edge SDK. |

## 5 Traction to Date  

* **Prototype repos**  
  * `gerbe_obstruction_detector.py` – policy blobs  
  * `gerbe_embedding_demo.py` – multilingual embeddings (now with `--save-fig`)  
  * `gerbe_edge_demo.py` – 64‑D federated drift simulator
