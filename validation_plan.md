Below is a **“prove‑it‑before‑pitch‑it” validation plan**—everything you can do **without** showing a single slide to a prospect.  Each step gives a binary result (“works / doesn’t”) so you can kill weak ideas early or walk into customer calls armed with data.

| Stage | Goal | How to run it | Pass/Fail line | Cost / Time |
|-------|------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| **1. Scalability spike** | Make sure k‑simplex math won’t melt at enterprise scale. | • Extend `bench/` folder: generate 1 000 contexts × 128‑D, avg deg ≈ 4.<br>• Implement two optimizations<br>  ① *Sparse BFS pruning* (check only within R hops).<br>  ② *Batch mat‑mult on GPU*.<br>• Measure wall‑time & peak RAM. | **Pass:** k = 3 done in \< 30 s & \< 8 GB. | 1 eng × 3 days |
| **2. Morphism taxonomy drill** | Prove ≥ 70 % of real transforms are *reversibilizable*. | • Grab 3 open‑source LLM repos (e.g. Hugging Face adapter merges, LoRA).<br>• List 20 transforms; write stub `approx_inverse()` for each.<br>• Unit‑test round‑trip error. | **Pass:** ≥ 14 of 20 within tolerance. | 1 eng × 2 days |
| **3. Synthetic falsification harness** | Ensure detector catches *only* real contradictions. | • Randomly generate thousands of graphs with known injected bugs (numeric & policy).<br>• Compute precision/recall. | **Pass:** F1 > 0.9.<br>**Fail:** lots of false alarms = tweak thresholds. | 1 eng × 1 day |
| **4. Auto‑graph PoC (dog‑food)** | Verify “drop‑in” claim. | • Write `gerbe scan` that parses your *own* repo’s GitHub Actions + Terraform to emit a context YAML.<br>• Wire into internal CI.<br>• Count manual edits needed. | **Pass:** < 30 min human tweak. | 1 eng × 2 days |
| **5. Competitive shadow test** | Show Gerbe finds bugs incumbents miss. | • Fork Langfuse sample app; inject second‑order bug (policy conflict only visible over two hops).<br>• Run Langfuse drifts, Great Expectations, etc.—verify silence.<br>• Run Gerbe detector—expect flag. | **Pass:** Gerbe flag, competitors silent. | 1 eng × 2 days |
| **6. Red‑team the math** | Stress‑test theory edge‑cases. | • Hire one grad‑student contractor (cat‑theory background) on Upwork for a week.<br>• Ask them to craft pathological graphs (non‑associative ops, noisy inverses). | **Pass:** No crash & flag rate reasonable. | \$1–2 k |
| **7. Cost-of-bug model** | Attach $ value to a catch. | • Scrape public fines/bug post‑mortems (COPPA, GDPR, rogue summary emails).<br>• Map each to a Gerbe‑detectable pattern; store CSV. | **Pass:** ≥ 3 events with \$>100 k losses, Gerbe could have prevented. | 0.5 day research |

Once **Stages 1–3** are green you know the core tech holds water.  
If **Stages 4–5** are also green you have differentiation and ease‑of‑use.  
Fail anywhere? Patch or pivot **before** any prospect ever sees a demo.

Treat each folder as a PR “experiment shard”; merge only on green check‑boxes.  
In three weeks you’ll either:

* have a metrics‑backed story ready for design‑partners, **or**  
* discover a blocker while burn‑rate is still near zero.

That’s the cheapest possible validation path.
